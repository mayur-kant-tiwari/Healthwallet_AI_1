HealthWallet AI
---------------
An AI-powered digital health record and healthcare expense management platform.

HealthWallet AI is a hackathon project focused on building a scalable backend foundation for managing health records and healthcare-related expenses. The project is designed to evolve into an AI-powered platform that combines health data storage with intelligent analysis and insights.

Problem Statement
-----------------
Healthcare data and healthcare expenses are highly fragmented. Medical records are spread across hospitals and reports, while expenses are difficult to track in one place. This fragmentation makes it hard for individuals to manage their health history and understand their healthcare spending.
HealthWallet AI addresses this problem by proposing a centralized digital system for health records and expenses.

Solution Overview
-----------------
-> HealthWallet AI provides a backend-first architecture that enables:
-> Centralized handling of health-related data
-> A scalable base for healthcare expense tracking
-> Future integration of AI modules for intelligent insights
-> The current implementation focuses on building a clean and extensible server architecture within hackathon constraints.

Key Features
------------
-> Currently Implemented
-> Node.js and Express-based backend server
-> Modular project structure for easy expansion
-> Planned Features
-> MongoDB integration for persistent data storage
-> Healthcare expense tracking
-> AI-based data analysis and insights
-> Frontend interface for users
-> Tech Stack
-> Backend
-> Node.js
-> Express.js

Frontend (Planned)
-----------------
-> HTML
-> CSS
-> JavaScript
-> Database (Planned)
-> MongoDB
-> AI (Planned)
Custom AI modules for analysis and predictions

How to Run the Project
----------------------
Prerequisites

Node.js

npm

Steps to Run
cd backend
npm install
node src/server.js

The backend server will start locally and will be ready for further development or testing.

Hackathon Scope
---------------
What’s Included
-> Frontend UI
-> Frontend UIBackend setup and architecture
-> Frontend UIClear separation of implemented vs planned features
-> Frontend UIScalable structure for post-hackathon development

What’s Not Included (Yet)
------------------------
Database persistence
-> AI logic
-> These are part of the post-hackathon roadmap.

Future Roadmap
--------------
-> Integrate MongoDB for data storage
-> Add authentication and security
-> Implement healthcare expense tracking
-> Introduce AI-powered insights
-> Build a user-facing frontend
